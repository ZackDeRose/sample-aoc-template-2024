# ts-aoc-starter

## Getting Started

This is a testing ground for the TS aoc template for 2024.

We want to support creating a new repo via:

```terminal
npx create-ts-aoc-starter
```

OR - by simply forking a repo that we will provide at a url.

## Running the Puzzles

Copy and paste the sample data given in the problem into the `day-1/a.data.sample.ts` file.

Copy and paste your larger unique actual data set into the `day-1/a.data.txt` file.

Add your solution to the `day-1/a.ts` file.

To run your solution against your sample data set, run the following command:

```terminal
nx day-1-a-sample
```

To run your solution against your actual data set, run the following command:

```terminal
nx day-1-a
```

** TODO: note on dynamic targets based on data convention. **
